**جواب ChatGPT4o:**  

در حال حاضر، پیش‌بینی دقیق نتیجه انتخابات تیر 1403 (ژوئیه 2024) برای هر کاندیدایی، از جمله مسعود پزشکیان، به دلیل نوسانات سیاسی، شرایط اجتماعی و اقتصادی و وضعیت نامشخص رأی‌دهندگان بسیار دشوار است. تحلیل‌گران معمولا بر اساس نظرسنجی‌ها، عملکرد گذشته، محبوبیت عمومی و برنامه‌های انتخاباتی کاندیداها پیش‌بینی‌هایی انجام می‌دهند. اما در نهایت نتیجه انتخابات به عوامل بسیاری وابسته است که ممکن است در طول زمان تغییر کنند.

اگرچه مسعود پزشکیان یکی از چهره‌های شناخته شده در سیاست ایران است، نتیجه دقیق انتخابات به حمایت عمومی، استراتژی کمپین او و همچنین رقبا و شرایط کلی کشور بستگی دارد. توصیه می‌شود که برای دریافت پیش‌بینی‌های دقیق‌تر، نظرسنجی‌ها و تحلیل‌های کارشناسان سیاسی را دنبال کنید.
